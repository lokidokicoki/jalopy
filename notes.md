# things to try

- instead of gtk, build a web ui using flask
- would need the following views:
  - select vehicle (store in session until another is selected)
    - edit vehicle
    - display vehicle stats
  - record fluff
    - add record to selected vehicle
    - edit record
  - charts:
    - historic prices
    - average mpg for selected vehicle
    - average mpg for all vehicles
- can still use the db and store in google drive
- would need to save to the db on every edit

- on init, load the db populate relevant data containers
- show list of available vehicles and 'add' view
- once a vehicle is selected, sub-nav with record/plot options
- simple forms with validation for each thing
